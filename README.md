# Spotify vs Apple Music: A Data Showdown

This Tableau project dives deep into the numbers to compare two music streaming titans: Spotify and Apple Music. Drawing on data from 2015 to 2024, it examines revenue, user growth, premium subscriptions and geographic trends to see who takes the top spot.

**Key findings**

* **Revenue rumble:** Spotify takes the crown with total revenue of $79.63 billion, while Apple Music holds its own with $52.96 billion thanks to strong premium pricing. By 2024 Spotify’s revenue had grown more than eightfold, outpacing Apple’s nearly threefold increase.
* **User uprising:** Spotify reigns supreme with about 3.27 billion total users, dwarfing Apple Music’s 0.57 billion total users. That huge audience reflects the power of Spotify’s free tier.
* **Premium powerhouse:** Spotify’s premium membership surged from 22 million in 2015 to 246 million in 2024, while Apple Music’s premium base expanded from 6.5 million to 95 million. Both services saw explosive growth, though Spotify’s funnel from free to paid listeners gives it a decisive edge.
* **Geography games:** Revenue is concentrated in a few key regions. EMEA delivers the biggest slice of Spotify’s revenue—about $5.84 billion—with Asia‑Pacific and North America close behind. Apple Music does not disclose regional splits, but its strongest markets are thought to be the United States and parts of Europe.
* **The loss rollercoaster**: Spotify’s annual income loss swung wildly, dropping below –$1.2 billion in 2017 before rebounding to $1.14 billion in 2024. These fluctuations underscore the high cost of rapid expansion. Apple Music’s financials aren’t broken out separately, but analysts believe the service has been profitable for years.
